# Uvajda-Counter

(Under construction) [Pull requests wanted]

The object of this game is to beat the toy cipher, Uvajda.

With community support we can show that together, physically together, we can conquer all positions in the bit stream.

Luckily, modern ciphers are built stronger and with more rounds than the cipher the entire world agrees upon.

# 14 + 2 + 1 = SN = 0
